# SI_507-Final_Project-shaoyw-hz

The program is made for searching world population information based on countries.

The homepage provides users with a table of populations for all the countries in the world.
Then the program allows the user to enter a country name to get more population information of that country.
There are three options for displaying more information:
    'general information' would lead to a page showing genernal information of the country, like region.
    'Large cities' would show a bar chart of cities with large population in that country.
    'Population history' would show a scattering plot of the population change of the country over time.
After the country name is entered and option is selected, click the 'SEARCH' button would lead to the result page.
If the name is not entered correctly (invalid input) or no option is selected, the 'SEARCH' button would lead to an error page.

All result pages and the error page has a link back to the homepage. And there is 'CLOSE' button on the homepage, by clicking which the page would be closed.
